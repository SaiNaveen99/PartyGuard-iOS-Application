#What is JIRA for?
Quick summary
•	Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by Atlassian.
•	It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions.
•	It allows us to track any kind of unit of work through a predefined workflow.
•	Both the unit and the workflow can be highly customized for our team's specific requirements, whether simple or more complex.
•	JIRA's really good at tracking  where all of our project items/issues lie at a team wide,  or individual level - for example, what are all of the issues assigned to me, created in the last 7 days?
•	Commenting and sharing issues via email all help make our work more visible to our team so folks stay on the same page throughout their project, release, or set of tasks.
